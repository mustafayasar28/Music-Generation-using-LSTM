                    Music21 durations are measured in Quarter Notes, for instance, an eight note has a 
                    duration of 0.5 and a 1 is a quarter note value. 
                    A Duration represents a span of musical time measurable in terms of quarter notes.

                    This is done because this operation simplifies the operation of the deep learning model without

                    between B (tonic for B major) and C (tonic for C major) and transpose it by using that distance
